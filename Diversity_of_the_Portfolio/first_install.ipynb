    "## What is Portfolio Diversity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio diversity measures how different your investments are from each other. Think of it like this:\n",
    "- **High diversity**: Your stocks behave very differently (when one goes up, another might go down)\n",
    "- **Low diversity**: Your stocks behave similarly (they all go up or down together)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this matter?** \n",
    "- Diverse portfolios are less risky\n",
    "- If one stock crashes, others might still do well\n",
    "- It's like the saying \"don't put all your eggs in one basket\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is ROA (Return on Assets)?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROA tells us how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It's calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{ROA} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Assets}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher ROA = Company is better at making money with what it owns.\n",
