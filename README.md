## 1. Install Required Software (if you don‚Äôt already have it).  

1. **Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**  
   - Download and install according to your operating system (Windows / Mac / Linux).  
   - After installation, open **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.  

2. **Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)**  
   - Anaconda is a tool to manage Python environments.  
   - After installation, check if it works:  
     - On Windows: open **Anaconda Prompt**.  
     - On Mac/Linux: open **Terminal**.  
     - Type:
       ```bash
       conda --version
       ```
       If you see a version number, Anaconda is installed correctly.  

3. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** 
   - Git is required to download this project from GitHub.  


## 2. Download the Project

1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. From the top menu, click **Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal** to open a terminal window.  
3. In the terminal, type:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oshikaka/Investment-Strategy.git
